# Business-management-transformation-with-e-Procurement-Software
Companies around the world have slowly transferred their procurement to payment processing from manual to a digital platform, ushering in the age of e-Procurement. With e-Procurement software becoming available across the globe, almost all big companies now solely rely on cloud-based e-procurement software to handle their massive procurement to pay processing. However, for the longest time, this service was reserved for the elite organizations with huge turnovers and a very high budget.  Now, with the TYASuite e-Procurement software, those times are long gone. With very affordable and reasonable pricing plans, it is an e-Procurement software for small businesses for the MSME sector, especially start-ups and low-budget organizations. Featuring a complete module with end to end procurement cycle management, automated PR, PO, Invoicing and Payment functions, a master database and guaranteed data security via AWS, the TYASuite  e-Procument module is the most affordable plug-and-play automated platform that integrate and streamline your e-Procurement process seamlessly.
